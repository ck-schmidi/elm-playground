# Elm Playground

I want to get more into Elm Programming so I'll start a simple playground project
for trying out different things with Elm.

For styling I'll use `elm-css` from `rtfeldman`. 

For playing around with a REST api I use `json-server` for providing a simple mock api. 

It can by started with `json-server -p 3001 api/api.json`.
